## üé® UX and UI Design <a id="ux-and-ui-design"></a>

Foody's UI is designed to be clean, modern, and fully responsive across all devices. The interface prioritizes usability, accessibility, and consistency across pages using Bootstrap 5.3.3 and modular CSS.

Styling is managed through:
- `SharedStyles.module.css` ‚Äì shared spacing, layout, and color variables.
- Individual `.module.css` files ‚Äì scoped styles for specific components.

### üé® Colour Scheme <a id="colour-scheme"></a>

The color palette uses soft, accessible tones to create a welcoming environment. High-contrast text ensures readability, while accent colors highlight interactive elements like buttons, links, and icons.

| Element           | Styling Source                  |
|-------------------|---------------------------------|
| Background        | `sharedStyles.pageContainer`    |
| Accent Elements   | `--accent-color` (custom var)   |
| Primary Text      | `--text-primary` (custom var)   |
| Buttons & Links   | Bootstrap + CSS module classes  |

> Color variables are defined and reused via `SharedStyles.module.css` to ensure visual consistency.

### üî† Typography <a id="typography"></a>

- **Primary Font**: `Roboto` ‚Äì clean and readable for body content.
- **Secondary Font**: `Open Sans` ‚Äì used for small labels, hints, and light UI elements.
- Fonts are imported globally in `index.css` and used with Bootstrap utilities and module-specific classes.

Font sizes, spacing, and hierarchy are optimized for readability across all screen sizes.

## üß™ Agile Workflow <a id="agile-workflow"></a>

This project followed an **Agile-inspired** approach using **GitHub Projects** and **Issues** for managing tasks, features, and bugs during the frontend development phase.

### üìã GitHub Projects <a id="github-projects"></a>

A **Kanban-style board** was used to track progress, with columns structured as:

1. **To Do** ‚Äì Features and enhancements planned for development  
2. **In Progress** ‚Äì Currently active development tasks  
3. **Done** ‚Äì Fully implemented, tested, and reviewed items

You can view the project board here:  
üîó [GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/users/Mustafa-Vienna/projects/7)

---

### üêõ GitHub Issues <a id="github-issues"></a>

Each major task or feature was tracked via GitHub Issues, with clear and descriptive titles. Instead of traditional labels like `bug` or `enhancement`, I used the MoSCoW prioritization method to categorize issues as `Must-Have`, `Should-Have`, `Could-Have`, or `Won‚Äôt-Have`.

This ensured transparent prioritization and alignment with project goals. All relevant commits were linked directly to these issues, enabling efficient tracking of development progress.

---

### üîÑ MoSCoW Prioritization <a id="moscow-prioritization"></a>

I used the **MoSCoW method** to prioritize features during planning and sprint retrospectives:

- **Must Have**: User authentication, post creation, commenting, profile views  
- **Should Have**: Liked posts page, reusable components, infinite scroll  
- **Could Have**: Search bar, dark mode, tag filters  
- **Won‚Äôt Have (for now)**: Messaging, post pinning, advanced notifications

---

### üìù Note on Agile Planning and User Stories

While this project followed an **Agile-inspired** methodology, the **user stories** and **Kanban board** were formally structured **at the end** of the development cycle.

In the early stages, my focus was fully on backend development. I followed the Code Institute‚Äôs Django REST Framework tutorial to build a secure, functional API that could support future frontend integration.

Once the backend was complete and tested, I moved on to developing the frontend. This phase came with its own challenges, especially due to **modern React library dependencies** and **limited source**. I spent significant time troubleshooting breaking changes, adjusting configurations, and ensuring everything worked smoothly with the backend.

As the project deadline approached, I retrospectively wrote detailed **user stories** based on the actual features implemented. I created them directly in GitHub Issues and added them to the Kanban board to reflect real progress.

Due to time constraints, all tickets were created and marked **‚ÄúDone‚Äù** on the same day. This ensured accurate documentation of work while maintaining transparency and alignment with Agile principles ‚Äî even if applied retrospectively.

This approach allowed me to clearly communicate what was achieved, what‚Äôs pending, and how the workflow evolved throughout the project.

## ‚úÖ Testing <a id="testing"></a>

The Foody frontend was manually and visually tested across various browsers, screen sizes, and usage scenarios to ensure consistent performance, functionality, and responsiveness. Each component and user interaction was carefully validated based on user stories and real-world expectations.

### üîç Manual Testing

- All pages were manually tested to verify layout, styling, and responsiveness.
- Buttons, forms, and interactive elements were tested for proper functionality and feedback.
- Navigation between routes (e.g., Home, Feed, Post Detail, Liked, Profile, Sign In/Up) was confirmed using both the navigation bar and direct links.
- API interactions (like post creation, liking, commenting) were tested via live backend integration.
- Responsive behavior was tested on Chrome Developer Tools (mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints).

### üß™ Browser Compatibility

Tested successfully on:

- Chrome (desktop & mobile)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

### üßë‚Äçüíª Component Testing

Although unit testing libraries were not implemented due to time constraints, each major React component (e.g., `PostCard`, `NavBar`, `PostCreateForm`, `LikeButton`, `CommentList`) was manually tested within the application through interaction, edge cases, and error states (e.g., empty form submissions, no internet connection).

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

- Form validation relies on backend responses and minimal frontend checks.

> Full testing documentation including specific user stories and testing scenarios is available in the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.
