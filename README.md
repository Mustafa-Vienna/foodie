## 🌟 Project Overview <a id="project-overview"></a>

**Foodie** is a full-featured **React frontend** for a modern recipe-sharing platform. It enables food lovers to explore, publish, and engage with recipes through a clean, interactive, and socially driven interface. The frontend communicates with a RESTful API built using Django and secured with JWT authentication, supporting full CRUD operations, user feedback (likes & comments), and personalized user profiles.

The interface is fully responsive and optimized for seamless use across all devices — mobile, tablet, and desktop.

## 🎨 UX and UI Design <a id="ux-and-ui-design"></a>

Foody's UI is designed to be modern, clean, and responsive across all screen sizes. Styling is managed using a combination of **Bootstrap 5.3.3** and **modular CSS**, with shared styles applied via `SharedStyles.module.css` to ensure design consistency and maintainability.

### 🎨 Colour Scheme <a id="colour-scheme"></a>

The color scheme emphasizes clarity and accessibility. Key visual roles such as background, primary text, and call-to-action buttons are styled using shared CSS variables and modular class utilities.

| Color Role       | Applied via CSS Module / Utility |
|------------------|----------------------------------|
| Background       | `sharedStyles.pageContainer`     |
| Accent Elements  | `--accent-color` (custom variable) |
| Text Color       | `--text-primary` (custom variable) |
| Links/Buttons    | Bootstrap utility + shared class |

> Centralized color values are defined in `SharedStyles.module.css` to ensure consistency across pages and components.

### 🔠 Typography <a id="typography"></a>

- **Primary Font**: `Roboto` for modern readability.
- **Secondary Font**: `Open Sans` for labels, hints, and smaller text.
- Font sizing and line height are adjusted using Bootstrap typography utilities and custom classes inside `SharedStyles.module.css`.

> Fonts are imported in the global `index.css` and applied selectively through reusable CSS modules for consistency and responsiveness.

## 🧪 Agile Workflow <a id="agile-workflow"></a>

This project followed an **Agile-inspired** approach using **GitHub Projects** and **Issues** for managing tasks, features, and bugs during the frontend development phase.

### 📋 GitHub Projects <a id="github-projects"></a>

A **Kanban-style board** was used to track progress, with columns structured as:

1. **To Do** – Features and enhancements planned for development  
2. **In Progress** – Currently active development tasks  
3. **Done** – Fully implemented, tested, and reviewed items

You can view the project board here:  
🔗 [GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/users/Mustafa-Vienna/projects/7)

---

### 🐛 GitHub Issues <a id="github-issues"></a>

Each major task or feature was tracked via GitHub Issues, with clear and descriptive titles. Instead of traditional labels like `bug` or `enhancement`, I used the MoSCoW prioritization method to categorize issues as `Must-Have`, `Should-Have`, `Could-Have`, or `Won’t-Have`.

This ensured transparent prioritization and alignment with project goals. All relevant commits were linked directly to these issues, enabling efficient tracking of development progress.

---

### 🔄 MoSCoW Prioritization <a id="moscow-prioritization"></a>

I used the **MoSCoW method** to prioritize features during planning and sprint retrospectives:

- **Must Have**: User authentication, post creation, commenting, profile views  
- **Should Have**: Liked posts page, reusable components, infinite scroll  
- **Could Have**: Search bar, dark mode, tag filters  
- **Won’t Have (for now)**: Messaging, post pinning, advanced notifications

---

### 📝 Note on Agile Planning and User Stories

While this project followed an **Agile-inspired** methodology, the **user stories** and **Kanban board** were formally structured **at the end** of the development cycle.

In the early stages, my focus was fully on backend development. I followed the Code Institute’s Django REST Framework tutorial to build a secure, functional API that could support future frontend integration.

Once the backend was complete and tested, I moved on to developing the frontend. This phase came with its own challenges, especially due to **modern React library dependencies** and **limited source**. I spent significant time troubleshooting breaking changes, adjusting configurations, and ensuring everything worked smoothly with the backend.

As the project deadline approached, I retrospectively wrote detailed **user stories** based on the actual features implemented. I created them directly in GitHub Issues and added them to the Kanban board to reflect real progress.

Due to time constraints, all tickets were created and marked **“Done”** on the same day. This ensured accurate documentation of work while maintaining transparency and alignment with Agile principles — even if applied retrospectively.

This approach allowed me to clearly communicate what was achieved, what’s pending, and how the workflow evolved throughout the project.

## ✅ Testing <a id="testing"></a>

The Foody frontend was manually and visually tested across various browsers, screen sizes, and usage scenarios to ensure consistent performance, functionality, and responsiveness. Each component and user interaction was carefully validated based on user stories and real-world expectations.

### 🔍 Manual Testing

- All pages were manually tested to verify layout, styling, and responsiveness.
- Buttons, forms, and interactive elements were tested for proper functionality and feedback.
- Navigation between routes (e.g., Home, Feed, Post Detail, Liked, Profile, Sign In/Up) was confirmed using both the navigation bar and direct links.
- API interactions (like post creation, liking, commenting) were tested via live backend integration.
- Responsive behavior was tested on Chrome Developer Tools (mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints).

### 🧪 Browser Compatibility

Tested successfully on:

- Chrome (desktop & mobile)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

### 🧑‍💻 Component Testing

Although unit testing libraries were not implemented due to time constraints, each major React component (e.g., `PostCard`, `NavBar`, `PostCreateForm`, `LikeButton`, `CommentList`) was manually tested within the application through interaction, edge cases, and error states (e.g., empty form submissions, no internet connection).

### ⚠️ Known Limitations

- Form validation relies on backend responses and minimal frontend checks.

> Full testing documentation including specific user stories and testing scenarios is available in the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.
