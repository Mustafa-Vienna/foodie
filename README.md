## üé® UX and UI Design <a id="ux-and-ui-design"></a>

Foody's UI is designed to be clean, modern, and fully responsive across all devices. The interface prioritizes usability, accessibility, and consistency across pages using Bootstrap 5.3.3 and modular CSS.

Styling is managed through:
- `SharedStyles.module.css` ‚Äì shared spacing, layout, and color variables.
- Individual `.module.css` files ‚Äì scoped styles for specific components.

### üé® Colour Scheme <a id="colour-scheme"></a>

The color palette uses soft, accessible tones to create a welcoming environment. High-contrast text ensures readability, while accent colors highlight interactive elements like buttons, links, and icons.

| Element           | Styling Source                  |
|-------------------|---------------------------------|
| Background        | `sharedStyles.pageContainer`    |
| Accent Elements   | `--accent-color` (custom var)   |
| Primary Text      | `--text-primary` (custom var)   |
| Buttons & Links   | Bootstrap + CSS module classes  |

> Color variables are defined and reused via `SharedStyles.module.css` to ensure visual consistency.

### üî† Typography <a id="typography"></a>

- **Primary Font**: `Roboto` ‚Äì clean and readable for body content.
- **Secondary Font**: `Open Sans` ‚Äì used for small labels, hints, and light UI elements.
- Fonts are imported globally in `index.css` and used with Bootstrap utilities and module-specific classes.

Font sizes, spacing, and hierarchy are optimized for readability across all screen sizes.

## üß™ Agile Workflow <a id="agile-workflow"></a>

This project followed an **Agile-inspired** approach using **GitHub Projects** and **Issues** for managing tasks, features, and bugs during the frontend development phase.

### üìã GitHub Projects <a id="github-projects"></a>

A **Kanban-style board** was used to track progress, with columns structured as:

1. **To Do** ‚Äì Features and enhancements planned for development  
2. **In Progress** ‚Äì Currently active development tasks  
3. **Done** ‚Äì Fully implemented, tested, and reviewed items

You can view the project board here:  
üîó [GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/users/Mustafa-Vienna/projects/7)

---

## üìà Agile Methodology <a id="agile-methodology"></a>

This project followed an Agile approach using a GitHub Kanban Board for iterative planning, tracking, and task management. Each task was created as a GitHub Issue and prioritized using the MoSCoW Method (Must-Have, Should-Have, Could-Have, Won't-Have). Issues progressed through stages: `Backlog`, `Ready`, `In Progress`, `In Review`, and `Done`.

### üß© Workflow Highlights

> ### üìù Note on Agile Planning and User Stories
>
> While this project adopted an Agile mindset, the Kanban board and user stories were finalized toward the end of development. This was necessary due to the focus on backend development in the initial phase, where I followed the Code Institute's Django REST Framework tutorials to build a strong foundation.
>
> During frontend development, additional time was spent overcoming compatibility issues with modern React libraries, limited documentation, and breaking changes. These challenges were addressed iteratively, with each task documented in GitHub Issues.
>
> As the submission deadline approached, all implemented features were carefully documented as user stories and moved into the Done column on the Kanban board. This ensures transparency and an accurate reflection of the completed work.

## ‚úÖ Testing <a id="testing"></a>

The Foody frontend was manually and visually tested across various browsers, screen sizes, and usage scenarios to ensure consistent performance, functionality, and responsiveness. Each component and user interaction was carefully validated based on user stories and real-world expectations.

### üîç Manual Testing

- All pages were manually tested to verify layout, styling, and responsiveness.
- Buttons, forms, and interactive elements were tested for proper functionality and feedback.
- Navigation between routes (e.g., Home, Feed, Post Detail, Liked, Profile, Sign In/Up) was confirmed using both the navigation bar and direct links.
- API interactions (like post creation, liking, commenting) were tested via live backend integration.
- Responsive behavior was tested on Chrome Developer Tools (mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints).

### üß™ Browser Compatibility

Tested successfully on:

- Chrome (desktop & mobile)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

### üßë‚Äçüíª Component Testing

Although unit testing libraries were not implemented due to time constraints, each major React component (e.g., `PostCard`, `NavBar`, `PostCreateForm`, `LikeButton`, `CommentList`) was manually tested within the application through interaction, edge cases, and error states (e.g., empty form submissions, no internet connection).

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

- Form validation relies on backend responses and minimal frontend checks.

> Full testing documentation including specific user stories and testing scenarios is available in the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.
